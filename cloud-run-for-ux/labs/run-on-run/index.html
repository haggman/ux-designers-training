      <google-codelab-step label="Create New Images" duration="5">
        <p>If you haven&#39;t already, recreate your images without the .env files. We&#39;ll handle the environmental variables through Cloud Run. After you&#39;ve removed the .env files, simply run the builds submit command again for each component (remember to navigate into the folder for each before running the command):</p>
<pre><code>gcloud builds submit . -t gcr.io/[PROJECT_NAME]/[IMAGE_NAME]:[TAG]
</code></pre>

      <google-codelab-step label="Deploy Services to Cloud Run" duration="20">
        <p>Here you&#39;ll get to see the beauty of Cloud Run and how simple it is compared to everything you&#39;ve done in this class so far. Navigate to Cloud Run in the console and do the following steps for each component (do the web app last):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create Service.</li>
<li>Give it a name, and click <strong>Allow unauthenticated invocations</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the appropriate image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>SHOW ADVANCED SETTINGS</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>Container port</strong> based on the port you have the component running on internally in the container.</li>
<li>Switch to the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> tab and enter environmental variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason you are doing web app last is so that you have the locations of the other components to provide to the web app as environmental variables.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong><br>In the real world, you would allow unauthenticated invocations for the web app, but not for the events and users microservices. Instead you&#39;d configure permissions to specifically allow these calls from the web app.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS: Configure Service-to-Service Authentication</strong><br>To give that a shot, you&#39;ll need to recreate your events and users services to not allow unathenticated invocations. Next follow the instructions for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/service-to-service" target="_blank">Authenticating service-to-service</a> on Cloud Run.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Release a Change" duration="10">
        <p>Try making a change and redeploy a new revision through Cloud Run. The steps are pretty simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make your changes in the application code.</li>
<li>Build a new image with Cloud Build.</li>
<li>Edit the service and choose the new image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>DEPLOY</strong> to release your new version.</li>
<li>After it has completed and shows that it is serving 100% of traffic to your new revision, check it out in the browser to make sure you see your new change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a few moments to poke around at the features and options. In particular, try clicking <strong>MANAGE TRAFFIC</strong> under the <strong>REVISIONS</strong> tab and see that you can split traffic as you see fit. This is a great way to test two different versions of your app, either as a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" target="_blank">Canary Release</a> or an A/B test. An A/B test is the same technical process as a canary release, the only difference is that you are testing different funtionality to see which you want to choose, instead of just confirming that a new release isn&#39;t problematic.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Cleanup" duration="1">
        <p>Since we used the fully managed version of Cloud Run, you don&#39;t necessarily need to delete your Services. You are only charged for what you use, and even then there is a free tier. As long as you don&#39;t expect these will get called very much, you should not be charged at all. But just to be safe and cleanly, if you don&#39;t plan to use them, go ahead and delete them.</p>
